Instructions to run the code:
1- edit input.txt so that the first line is the connection url to mongodb.
Example:
“mongodb://localhost:27017/” (without the quotes)
You can use the one I provided in there, but you'll have to give me your IP so I can whitelist it. It will not work otherwise.
2- edit input.txt so that the second line is the domain name.
Example: http://localhost/
3-Navigate to the virtual environment (urlenv folder) and activate it using the command: "source bin/activate" (on Linux)
4-Simply run the file urlshortener.py using the command "python urlshortener.py".
That's all folks!
